# Java Solutions

This directory contains all my java solutions categorized by difficulty level.

## How to Use

You can navigate through each category to explore problems of varying difficulty levels. Additionally, an Excel sheet is available with a database of all Java solutions, which I use for revision. Columns like Rating and Last Solved help me filter and prioritize problems for practice effectively.

- [Easy Problems](easy/)
